            Stylz is a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) platform designed for a client in Saudi Arabia. The platform serves
            as a digital ecosystem for businesses in the beauty and wellness industry, providing booking, management,
            and customer engagement features. However, despite its potential, the existing system suffered from serious
            technical bottlenecks, making it difficult to scale and innovate.

        <p>Before our intervention, Stylz was plagued with several technical and architectural issues:</p>
        <ul className="challenge-list">
          <li>
            <strong>Tightly Coupled Codebase:</strong> The existing backend (BE) was not modular, making feature updates
            and bug fixes cumbersome.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Poor Maintainability:</strong> Lack of a clear architectural pattern meant that even minor
            modifications risked breaking core functionalities.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Performance Bottlenecks:</strong> The slow response times of the backend caused significant lag on
            both the web and mobile applications.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Lack of Documentation:</strong> No formal documentation existed for the legacy system, making
            onboarding and debugging highly inefficient.

          <p>
            By applying strategic software engineering principles and leveraging our expertise in Django,
            React, and MySQL, Luminosa successfully transformed Stylz from a struggling platform into a
            robust, scalable, and high-performing SaaS product. This project reinforced the importance
            of understanding business logic, re-engineering systems with scalability in mind, and
            maintaining a strong focus on user experience.
          </p>
          <p>
            With the new architecture in place, Stylz is now well-positioned for future growth,
            innovation, and market leadership in Saudi Arabia's beauty and wellness industry.
